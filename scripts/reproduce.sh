# Reproduce every computational claim in NOTES.md for Erdős problem #200.
#
# Stages:
#   1. fetch primary sources          (refs/fetch.sh; nothing is redistributed)
#   2. build the enumerator           (clang -O3)
#   3. verify the 26 known records    four checks, incl. an OEIS-independent source
#   4. assumption-free cross-check    ref_bruteforce.py, which shares no code with apsearch
#   5. exhaustive re-derivation       k = 8..20, the last to B = a(20) = 5.73e11
#   6. heuristic vs measurement       singular series, 30 count comparisons, KS calibration
#   7. the sieve barrier              and the L(N) tables
#   8. final_check.py                 re-derives every claim from the artifacts; exit 0 = pass
#   9. lean/verify.sh                 axiom audit + statement fidelity for the formal part
#  10. lean-pnt/verify.sh             the same bound with the PNT hypothesis discharged
#
# Needs: clang, curl, python at ~/.venvs/main/bin/python (numpy, sympy).
# Stages 9 and 10 additionally need elan/lake; each is skipped with a notice if lake is
# absent. Their first runs download ~7.7 GB of Mathlib + formal-conjectures oleans and
# build ~7.4 GB of PrimeNumberTheoremAnd respectively.
# Runtime is dominated by stage 5.  On 10 otherwise-idle threads the k=20 run alone
# takes ~67 min and the whole stage several hours; k=16, despite a smaller bound, is
# also expensive because W_16 = 30030 leaves a large m-range.  Set FAST=1 to cap the
# exhaustive runs at k <= 15.  NT sets the thread count.  These figures degrade badly
# under competing load: a FAST=1 NT=3 run on a busy machine took 3.5 h.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/reproduce.sh
#
# FAST=1 stops stage 5 at k=15.  Note that final_check.py scans every run in
# results/, so with FAST=1 it still reports the higher k from the committed runs
# rather than from ones this script just produced.
