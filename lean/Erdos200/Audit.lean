# Axiom audit

A declaration can compile and still be vacuous, either because it (or something it depends on)
used `sorry`, or because the statement is not the one intended.  This file checks the first
failure mode mechanically: `#assert_axioms` walks the full transitive dependency graph with
`Lean.collectAxioms` and **fails the build** if `sorryAx` appears.

`lake build` succeeding therefore certifies that every theorem listed below rests only on
`propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`, the three axioms of Lean's standard logic.

It does *not* certify the second failure mode.  For that, compare the statements against
`../../NOTES.md` by hand; `erdos_200_variants_upper` is stated to match
`Erdos200.erdos_200.variants.upper` in `FormalConjectures` verbatim except for the `PNT`
hypothesis.

### Statement fidelity

Compiling is not the same as proving the right thing.  This compares the elaborated
`Expr` of our conclusion, after stripping the `PNT` binder, against the elaborated `Expr` of
`Erdos200.erdos_200.variants.upper` in `FormalConjectures` (which is `sorry` there).  Any
difference in quantifier order, coercion, or the meaning of `=o` is a build failure.
