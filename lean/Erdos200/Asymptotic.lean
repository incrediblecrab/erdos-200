# The asymptotic upper bound for Erdős problem 200

Write `L n` for `Erdos200.longestPrimeArithmeticProgressions n`, the length of the longest
arithmetic progression of primes inside `[1, n]`.  Proposition 2 gives `θ(L n) < log n + log 2`,
so any lower bound `θ(k) ≥ (c - o(1)) k` turns into `L n ≤ (1/c + o(1)) log n`.

* Unconditionally, Mathlib's `Chebyshev.theta_ge` supplies `c = log 2`, giving
  `L n ≤ (1/log 2 + o(1)) log n` with `1/log 2 = 1.4426…`.
* With the prime number theorem `θ(x)/x → 1` it supplies `c = 1`, giving the
  literature form `L n ≤ (1 + o(1)) log n`, which is
  `FormalConjectures`' `Erdos200.erdos_200.variants.upper`.

Mathlib at the revision pinned by this project does **not** contain the prime number theorem,
so `PNT` below is an explicit hypothesis, not a theorem.  Nothing here addresses the open
part of Erdős 200, which asks for `L n = o(log n)`.

/-- `Set.IsAPOfLength` is an existential statement about a set; this unpacks it into the
concrete data `a, d` used by `Erdos200.Bound`, including `d ≥ 1` (a constant "progression"
`d = 0` is a one-element set, so it cannot have length `≥ 3`). -/
